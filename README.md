# GS-stars-motion
A Good and Simple stars and celestial body visual presentation simulation system.
# WIP
# Application
- Simulation of stars in night sky in games
- Simulate space in webpages
- Generate live background for wallpaper, art or videos
- Not for scientific or astomical applications
# Features
- High performance
  - Cache utilization
  - Register focused design
  - Parallel processing for mass quality simulations
  - Custom or auto hardware scan for above information
- 2D or 3D simulation
  - 2D: view stars motion on 2D plane, can custom distance to screen
  - 3D: view stars motion as part of a 3D system 
- Custom stars
  - Number
  - Location
  - Size
  - Radiation wavelength (Calculate colour)
  - Speed
  - Random support for all aboves number for all above values with chance based on actual star systems
- Custom viewpoint
  - Location (3D)
  - (3D) Facing
  - (3D) Facing rotation angle and speed (simulate viewpoint star rotation)
  - Visible stars angle (calculate stats in view angle)
  - Random support
- Demo
  - Render visual effect into basic image
  - Render visual effect into basic video
